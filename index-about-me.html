                    <h2> About Me</h2>
                    <p>I'm Kaliel Selhorst, 19 years old, a software developer focused on back-end and information security, passionate about creating scalable, modern, and well-structured solutions. I have experience in Java, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails, working on projects ranging from management and automation systems to complete web applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a special interest in cybersecurity, blockchain, applied AI, and RESTful API development, always seeking to integrate best security practices (LGPD, encryption, 2FA) and performance into projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides the technical side, I enjoy working with GitHub and team collaboration practices, using branches, versioning, and clear documentation to keep projects organized. I also explore creative areas, such as game development in HTML/CSS/JS and automations for data processing and smart reports.

                        <div class="timeline-description">
                            Started my journey with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, creating personal websites and small games.
                            My first contact was through Harvard's CS50 course, which opened the doors to the world of programming,
                            computational logic, and computer science.

                        <div class="timeline-description">
                           Deepened my studies in Python, Java, and computational logic.
                           This was the year I created my first more robust practical projects, such as complete websites and simple automations.
                           I also started learning about GitHub concepts, versioning, and code collaboration, a foundation I use to this day.

                        <div class="timeline-description">
                            Consolidated my fundamentals with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating more elaborate websites and games,
                            such as an advanced version of Space Invaders. First practical contact with back-end in Java
                            and integration of front-end with more complex logic.

                            Explored Python applied to data analysis, machine learning, and AI.
                            Created automations for reports, API simulations, and used artificial intelligence in creative projects,
                            interactive dashboards, and data manipulation.

                            Deepened my knowledge in Java 21, Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, and React.
                            Developed systems such as a complete task manager,
                            focusing on scalability, security (LGPD, 2FA, encryption), and data export.
                            Also worked on projects extracting financial information from PDFs and images with validation and export to Excel/PDF.

                        but also exploring modern front-end and AI integration. I want to apply my knowledge in Java, Python,
                        JavaScript, and information security to build solutions that truly make a difference — whether
                        in management systems, automation, cybersecurity, or creative projects like games and web applications.
